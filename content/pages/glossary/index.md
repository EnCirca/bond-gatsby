**TLD**

A Top Level Domain (TLD) are domains at the highest level in the hierarchical Domain Name System.  The most popular TLD in Web2 is .com, however, Web3 TLDs can be anything the user wants it to be, such as .AltRoots. The leading platform for alternative top-level domains is Handshake. Others include NexBloc and Decentraweb. These platforms have temporarily reserved trademarks to be claimed only by trademark owners. 

**SLD**

A second-level domain (SLD) is a domain that is directly below a top-level domain. The two most popular platforms for second level NFT domains are Unstoppable Domains (UD) and the Ethereum Naming Service. The .ETH TLD is the sole TLD for the Ethereum Naming Service and launched in May 2017. UD is a Venture capital backed startup offering NFT domains in 9 different alternative roots, including .CRYPTO, .WALLET, .NFT and others.
